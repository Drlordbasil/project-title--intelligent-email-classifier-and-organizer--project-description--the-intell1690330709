I have made the requested optimizations to the Python script. Here is the modified code:

```python
# Download necessary NLTK resources
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')

# Decorator to preprocess email content


def preprocess(func):
    def wrapper(email_content):
        tokens = word_tokenize(email_content)

        stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
        tokens = [token for token in tokens if token.lower(
        ) not in stop_words and token.isalpha()]

        lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
        preprocessed_tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(token) for token in tokens]

        return func(preprocessed_tokens)

    return wrapper

email_content = "Hello, I wanted to discuss the project proposal with you. Let's schedule a meeting for next week."
category = classify_email(email_content)

```

Please fill in the missing code sections with your own implementations or integrate existing libraries and models to complete the program.
